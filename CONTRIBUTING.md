# Contributing to The Muses Projects
We use the Agile/Lean methodology of software development. This means we keep things as simple as possible and create iterative designs, with an MVP first and then constantly improve the project from this point on.

Volunteer developers are able to work their own chosen hours and to work remotely from anywhere in the world. Developers can either choose what tasks they would like to work on or if they wish they can be assigned tickets for needed features. Each project at The Muses has its own documentation, which describes needed features.

If you need any further info or would like to be given access to be a contriubtor pelase visit [The Muses](https://the-muses.org/) and speak to our chatbot or send an email to themusesorganisation@gmail.com and we will get you on board.

## Github Etiquette
When using github, The Muses uses the following pattern: 
1. Create a branch off the “develop” branch, with a descriptive name, then complete the objective of this task.
2. Create a pull request into develop branch
3. Branch will be reviewed, if accepted then the branch will be accepted into the develop branch to be tested on the staging website.
4. If code passes testing it will be merged into the master branch and be pushed to the live site.
